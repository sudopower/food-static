                    of your meal. Avoid cooking methods that add unhealthy fats (saturated and
                    trans fats) or let food cook in its own fat. Instead, use these heart-healthy

                    <p> Exposing oils to high heat can result in the production of oxidized compounds and free radicals that are harmful for your health. You can control this oxidization of compounds by using an oil with a higher smoke point that reduces fumes.</p>

                    <p class="bold mt-2">Tips and hacks:</p>
                    
                    <li> While roasting veggies cut them into equal sizes for even cooking.</li>
                    <li> Do not overcrowd the pan as it results in a soggy outcome.</li>
                    <li> When roasting meats, place them over a rack so the fat drips away.</li>
                    
                    
                    <p class="mt-2"> Roasting starchy plant-based food (like potatoes and bread) may pose a health risk when they're over-roasted. In addition, over-roasting can result in the formation of acrylamide, a compound which may be linked to cancer. To avoid over-roasting, cook potatoes till they are golden yellow.</p>

                    <li> When fat drips and burns on the grill, the resulting smoke contains Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) which has been linked to cancer. You can reduce the formation of PAHs by lining the grill with a foil perforated with holes.</li>
                    <li> Don't consume the charred particles on the food and the grill.</li>
                    <li> Marinating food for a while before cooking also limits the formation of potential
 carcinogens while grilling.</li>
                    <li> Cook for longer at a lower temperature.</li>
                    <li> Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from vegetables and other food.</li>
