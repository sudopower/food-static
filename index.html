                    <p> Exposing oils to high heat can result in the production of oxidized compounds and free radicals that are harmful for your health. You can control this oxidization of compounds by using an oil with a higher smoke point that reduces fumes.</p>

                    <p class="bold mt-2">Tips and hacks:</p>
                    
                    <li> While roasting veggies cut them into equal sizes for even cooking.</li>
                    <li> Do not overcrowd the pan as it results in a soggy outcome.</li>
                    <li> When roasting meats, place them over a rack so the fat drips away.</li>
                    
                    
                    <p class="mt-2"> Roasting starchy plant-based food (like potatoes and bread) may pose a health risk when they're over-roasted. In addition, over-roasting can result in the formation of acrylamide, a compound which may be linked to cancer. To avoid over-roasting, cook potatoes till they are golden yellow.</p>

                    <li> When fat drips and burns on the grill, the resulting smoke contains Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) which has been linked to cancer. You can reduce the formation of PAHs by lining the grill with a foil perforated with holes.</li>
                    <li> Don't consume the charred particles on the food and the grill.</li>
                    <li> Marinating food for a while before cooking also limits the formation of potential
 carcinogens while grilling.</li>
                    <li> Cook for longer at a lower temperature.</li>
                    <li> Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from vegetables and other food.</li>

                    <p>One of the most widespread non-stick coatings used in cookware is Teflon, which comes with many concerns. This coating contains harmful chemicals which have been linked to several types of cancer and also releases toxic fumes when heated.</p>

                <div class="text left mb-4 mt-4">
                    <p>Moreover, Teflon coating is thin and can chip easily. Once it's chipped, you need to immediately dispose of the cookware. </p>

                <div class="text left mb-4 mt-4">
                    <p>Aluminium is a neurotoxic metal. Elevated aluminium levels have been linked to several central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer's and ALS. Though aluminium cookware is usually coated, the coating is prone to chipping, releasing the toxic metal into your food.</p>

                    <p>When aluminium is placed in an acid solution and exposed to an electric current, a layer of aluminium oxide is deposited on the surface of the aluminium. This process is called anodization.</p>

                <div class="text left mb-4 mt-4">
                    <p>Anodized aluminium cookware conducts heat as well as ordinary aluminium, but has a hard, non- stick surface which makes it scratch-resistant, durable, and easy to clean. Anodization also reduces leaching of aluminium from cookware into foods, particularly acidic foods like tomatoes.</p>

                    <p>Stainless steel is a metal alloy made from combination of steel and other metals including nickel and chromium. It is a healthy cookware choice unless it is worn or damaged. It's relatively lightweight and resistant to scratches. However, stainless steel isn't great for frying or saut&eacute;ing as it isn't non-stick.</p>
