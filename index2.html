                    <p class="bold mt-2 mb-1">Tips and hacks:</p>
                    
                    <li> While roasting veggies cut them into equal sizes for even cooking.</li>
                    <li> Do not overcrowd the pan as it results in a soggy outcome.</li>
                    <li> When roasting meats, place them over a rack so the fat drips away.</li>
                    
                    
                    <p class="mt-2"> Roasting starchy plant-based food (like potatoes and bread) may pose a health risk when they're over-roasted. In addition, over-roasting can result in the formation of acrylamide, a compound which may be linked to cancer. To avoid over-roasting, cook potatoes till they are golden yellow.</p>

                    <li> When fat drips and burns on the grill, the resulting smoke contains Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) which has been linked to cancer. You can reduce the formation of PAHs by lining the grill with a foil perforated with holes.</li>
                    <li> Don't consume the charred particles on the food and the grill.</li>
                    <li> Marinating food for a while before cooking also limits the formation of potential
 carcinogens while grilling.</li>
                    <li> Cook for longer at a lower temperature.</li>
                    <li> Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from vegetables and other food.</li>

                    <p>Aluminium is a neurotoxic metal. Elevated aluminium levels have been linked to several central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer's and ALS. Though aluminium cookware is usually coated, the coating is prone to chipping, releasing the toxic metal into your food.</p>
